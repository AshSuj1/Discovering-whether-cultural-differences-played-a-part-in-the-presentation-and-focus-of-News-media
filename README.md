Focus: The hypothesis developed was concerned with whether cultural differences played a part in the presentation of world events.
Open data resource that collected Newspaper headlines from the past decade, from two Media outlets with different cultural backgrounds.
Text was wrangled into n-gram size 1 with an associated count. The purpose was to devise whether there was commonality in the overall level of negativity or positivity used by both media outlets.
Headlines concerning specific world events were compared and sentiment analysis was used to quantitatively analyse the level of polarity in the text.
Visualisations using R and D3 were developed to communicate that the there were no large differences in sentiment shared by both news outlets. In fact, it appeared that there was a trend to follow the Western take on world events.
